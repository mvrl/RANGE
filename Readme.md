This is the repository for Scale Adaptive and Probablistic Geoembeddings (SAPCLIP). This work present a new idea of thinking of geo embeddings as a distribution over the image embeddings across the area which they are supposed to cover. Since a lat-lon only refers to the center coordinate the embedding itself can represent the land at different scale. We formulate this learning problem as learning the distribution which generates the image embeddings within a certain bound.
